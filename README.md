General Purpose Documentation on Automation related topics.  

 This git repo highlights some of my ideas and the implementation process. However, nothing in this repository is guaranteed to work for you in your specific situation, and your use cases may vary.  

## About
I have worked professionally in the DevOps space for at least  years and as a system administrator for at least a decade. I chose to separate the two distinct job titles because of the techniques employed, manual processes rather than automated ones. Most of the testing will be done in my home lab, where I have potluck servers I've acquired over the years. These machines are desktops converted to pseudo servers. In a nutshell, not only do I work in DevOps as a career professionally, but I am also a technology hobbyist. The most important thing about approaching your ideas as a hobby is the ability to choose your technologies. After all, a hobby should be fun and enjoyable to do.
