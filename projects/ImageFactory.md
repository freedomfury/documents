# Image Factory

Documentation regarding building an image factory using Packer Ansible and other tools. The chosen technologies are based on personal preference or desire to learn more about the tech. The idea is to create a factory that most operations teams could support. My intention is not to build a software product from the ground up. As such, most of the code would be written in bash or Python; these scripting languages act as the glue between bigger software components, such as Packer, Terraform, and Ansible. The project will follow the GitOps workflow style.
