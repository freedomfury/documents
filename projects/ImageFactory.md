# Image Factory

Documentation regarding building image factory, using Packer Ansible and other tools. The technologies chosen here have to do with personal preference or wanting to learn more about the particular technology chosen. The idea is to create a factory that most operations teams could support. My intention is not to build a software product from the ground up. As such, most of the code would be bash or Python, which acts as glue between bigger software components, such as Packer. The project will follow GitOps workflow styled workflow.
